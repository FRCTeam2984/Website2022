IMPORTANT NEW NOTES:
- dropdown header is not working righ now but ill fix it later
- footer and headers are dynamically loaded from their own .html documents

Most important stuff TO DO:
- Make responsive drop down menu (greg)
- Make waves responsive and not lead off of screen (aram pls do this)
- make footer stay at bottom all the time

To Do:

- Add Boat animation on home page
- all sponsors page
- calendar page (I think we can probably wait to do this after thursday)
- google calendar integration
- lots more stuff that i don't want to write rn (shut up aram, i gotchu)

The stuff aram didn't want to right down at that particular moment:
- Fix waves going all funky during phone and tablet mode
- responsivity in general
- Styling up joining page
- Styling up header buttons (I (GREG) can do this tmrw (5/31))
- Integrating the links at the bottom of the home page
- Making a better boat in pixelart or vector art (prob vector art)
