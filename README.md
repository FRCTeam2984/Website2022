- Add Boat animation on home page
- all sponsors page
- calendar page (I think we can probably wait to do this after thursday)
- google calendar integration

The stuff aram didn't want to right down at that particular moment:
- Fix waves going all funky during phone and tablet mode
- responsivity in general
- Styling up joining page
- Stylign up header buttons (I (GREG) can do this tmrw (5/31))
- Integrating the links at the bottom of the home page
- Making a better boat in pixelart or vector art (prob vector art)
